SQLite for lock management

Thoughts
========
Should use FastCGI so reponse time is acceptable.
Should avoid interrogating filesystem on startup to make things quicker.
Should support write locks and shared and exclusive locks.
Should support lock timeouts and administrative unlock.
Should use a SQLite database to manage locks and properties.
Filesystem should only contain collection names, collection content, resource names, resource content
Datamodel should include collection, resource, property, lock

Warnings
========
This project does not provide any authentication.  This should be performed using Basic Authentication.
Likewise, SSL should be used to ensure that credntials, properties and content are not in the clear.
Underlying filesystem should not be accessed excxept by webdav, no direct manipulation
Use cadaver (like ftp) if you need to do command line maniuplation
